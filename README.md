# Predict exports
The objective of the project is to test various approaches to predicting exports for the months where the data are not yet publicshed using data on more timely economic variables - the type of preodiction analysis known as 'nowcasting'. The notebooks predict exports using Random Forests and Gradient Boosted Trees.
