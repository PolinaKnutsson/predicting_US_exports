# Predict exports
The objective of the project is to test various approaches to predicting exports for the months where the data are not yet published using data on more timely economic variables - the type of prediction analysis known as 'nowcasting'. The notebooks use historical data on exports and other economic variables and predict export values using Random Forests and Gradient Boosted Trees.
